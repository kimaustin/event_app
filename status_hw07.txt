Web Dev Spring 2021 HW07 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
	Austin Kim


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
	https://github.com/kimaustin/event_app.git


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
	https://events.wbdbvaustinkim.com


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
	No. I was able to set up a lot of the database piping and start working on letting the interface allow for user and event creation, but I am missing a lot of the functionality. I had a lot of work done that was lost because I didn't push my work to git and my computer crapped out on me. I got really frustrated and wasn't able to get back to where I was. 	


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
	No.


6. If you would like the deployment for an old homework to be reconsidered, what
are the links to your Inkfish submission and deployed site?

If you could consider more than one, that would be a God send..... But if not, whichever one would warrant the most points back (probably assignment 3, subs:4676). Assignment 5 I shouldn't have gotten points off, and will be disputing with my grader, but am putting that in here anyways,
	https://inkfish.ntuck-neu.site/subs/4676
	-> http://hw03.wbdbvaustinkim.com/
	https://inkfish.ntuck-neu.site/subs/5542
	-> http://hw05.wbdbvaustinkim.com

And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
 - Development
 - Deployment
 - Submission
